== Feature Catalogue

[[sec_5.1]]
=== Introduction

The Feature Catalogue describes the feature types, information types,
attributes, attribute values, associations and roles which may be
used in the product. The S-131 Feature Catalogue is available in an
XML document which conforms to the S-100 XML Feature Catalogue Schema
and can be downloaded from the IHO Geospatial Information Registry
website (https://registry.iho.int/).

=== Feature types

Feature types contain descriptive attributes that characterize real-world
entities. The word 'feature' may be used in one of two senses -- feature
type and feature instance. A feature type is a class and is defined
in a Feature Catalogue. A feature instance is a single occurrence
of the feature type and represented as an object in a dataset.
A feature instance is located by a relationship to one or more spatial
instances. A feature instance may exist without referencing a spatial
instance.

[[sec_5.2.1]]
==== Geographic

Geographic (geo) feature types carries the descriptive characteristics
of a real-world entity (a location or place on the surface of the Earth).
In the context of hydrographic products, this includes the adjacent
regions from the sea floor to elevations of landforms and structures
above the Earth's surface.

[[sec_5.2.2]]
==== Meta

Meta features contain information about other features within a dataset.
Information defined by meta features override the default metadata
values defined by the dataset descriptive records. Meta attribution
on individual features overrides attribution on meta features.

[[sec_5.2.3]]
==== Cartographic

Cartographic features contain information about the cartographic representation
(including text) of real world entities.

[[sec_5.3]]
=== Information types

Information types define identifiable pieces of information in a dataset
that can be shared using information associations. They have attributes
but have no geometry.

[[sec_5.3.1]]
==== Spatial quality

Spatial quality attributes are carried in an information class called
*SpatialQuality* (<<fig_4.21>>) Only points and curves can be associated
with spatial quality. Currently no use case for associating surfaces
with spatial quality attributes has been identified, therefore this
is prohibited. Vertical uncertainty is prohibited for curves as this
dimension is not supported by curves.

[[sec_5.4]]
=== Feature and information relationships

A feature relationship links instances of one feature type with instances
of the same or a different feature type.

An information relationship links instances of feature types or information
types to instances of information types.

[[sec_5.5]]
=== Attributes

S-131 defines attributes as either simple or complex.

[[sec_5.5.1]]
==== Simple attributes

S-131 uses seven types of simple attributes; they are listed in the
following Table:

[[table_5-1]]
.Simple attribute types
[cols="a,a"]
|===
h| Type h| Definition

| Boolean                 | A logical value, either 'True' or 'False'
| Integer                 | An integer number
| Real                    | A floating point number
| Enumeration             | One of a list of predefined values
| Text or CharacterString | General text.
| Date
| A date gives values for year, month and day according to the Gregorian
Calendar. +
In XML formats including S-131, the XML Schema standard type
should be used instead of the ISO 8601 basic representation
(which is not a standard type in XML).

EXAMPLE&#58; 1998-09-18
| Truncated Date | A S100_TruncatedDate allows a date or partial date
to be given. At least one of the year/month/day components must be
present. Since S-131 uses XML formats for both dataset and metadata,
the XML encoding of truncated dates must be used (i.e., the ISO 8601
basic format is not used in S-131).

Components: +
YYYY Year integer between 0000 and 9999 +
MM Month integer between 01 -- 12 (inclusive) +
DD Day integer between 01 and 28, 29, 30, or 31 (inclusive), consistent with year
and month values if these are specified. +
This type can be used to encode recurring instants (see S-100 Part 3, clause 3-8).

EXAMPLE&#58; The appropriate XML Schema type should be used: `--12-17` representing
17 December of any year (conforming to the XML type (gMonthDay). S-100
Part 10b provides further details about encoding in GML datasets.

| Time | A 24-hour time, it may contain a time zone. Since S-131 uses
XML formats for both datasets and metadata, the XML encoding must
be used.

In XML formats (including S-131), the XML Schema standard
type should be used instead of the ISO 8601 basic representation
(which is not a standard type in XML).

EXAMPLE&#58; 18:30:59Z (local time in UTC); +
18:30:59+01:00 (local time with given offset); +
18:30:59 (local time without an offset to UTC).

| Codelist
| A type of flexible enumeration. A code list type is a list of literals
which may be extended only in conformance with specified rules.
| URI | A uniform resource identifier as defined in RFC 3986. Character
encoding of a URI shall follow the syntax rules defined in RFC 3986.

EXAMPLE&#58; http://registry.iho.int
| URL
| A uniform resource locator (URL) is a URI that provides a means
of locating the resource by describing its primary access mechanism
(RFC 3986).

EXAMPLE&#58; http://registry.iho.int
| URN | A persistent, location-independent, resource identifier that
follows the syntax and semantics for URNs specified in RFC 2141.

EXAMPLE&#58; urn:iho:s101:1:0:0:AnchorageArea

==== Complex attributes

Complex attributes are aggregations of other attributes that are either
simple or complex. The aggregation is defined by means of attribute
bindings. Bindings of complex attributes are represented in the S-131
UML diagrams by a local attribute (<<fig_5.1>>, *HarbourAreaAdministrative*
/ _generalHarbourInformation_ attribute, _generalHarbourInformation/weatherResource_
attribute as well as other complex attributes whose internal details
are not shown in this figure).

=== Units of measure

The following units of measure are used in Marine Harbour Infrastructure
datasets;

* Orientation is given in decimal degrees
* Radio frequency is given in hertz
* Uncertainty is given in metres
* Distances are given in metres or nautical miles
* Depths are given in metres.

The feature catalogue specifies the unit of measure for each attribute
for which a unit is needed.
