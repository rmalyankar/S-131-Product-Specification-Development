# Feature Catalogue

This folder is for work-in-progress feature catalogues and accompanying documentation. The official version for the finalized and approved Product Specification will be available from the GI Registry.

FC files for work in progress are named 131_FC_2.0.0.YYYYMMDD.xml where YYYYMMDD is the date of the draft, to be more consistent with apparent IHO Secretariat practice (which will probably replace "FC" with "Feature_Catalogue"...).
