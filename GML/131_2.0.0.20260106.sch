    Description: Schematron rule to check for existence of xsi:schemaLocation attributes on root elements of XML documents.
    Note       : Validation using Schematron rule files and XML schemas (XSD files) are in principle separate. XML tools
      may apply them in separate steps each requring manual triggering or in a pipeline, depending on the method used to
      validate instance documents.

        <sch:p>Note that this rule only checks for the existence of a schemaLocation attribute and does not validate the content of the
            schemaLocation attribute. In other words it does not check if the schema location is for the namespace of the root element.</sch:p>
