=== Introduction

The S-131 product is based on the S-100 General Feature Model (GFM),
and is a feature-based vector product. <<fig_4.1>> shows how the S-131
application schema is realized from the S-100 GFM. All S-131 features
and information classes are derived from one of the abstract classes
*FeatureType* and *InformationType* defined in the S-131 application
schema, which realize the GFM meta-classes S100_GF_FeatureType and
S100_GF_InformationType respectively.

=== Application Schema
S-131 conforms to the General Feature Model (GFM) from S-100
Part 3. This document describes the Application Schema expressed in
UML. This document contains only an overview of the S-131 application
schema. The S-131 Application Schema types are realised in the Feature
Catalogue. The Feature Catalogue is included as a separate Annex
(Annex C), and provides a full specification of all types including
feature and information types, their attributes, allowed values, and
relationships between types in the data product.

The following conventions are used in the UML diagrams depicting the
application schema:

* Standard UML conventions for classes, associations, inheritance,
roles, and multiplicities apply. These conventions are described in
Part 1 of S-100.
* Italic font for a class name indicates an abstract class.
* Feature classes are depicted with green background; the dark shade
for abstract feature classes and the light shade for ordinary (non-abstract)
feature classes.
* Information type classes are depicted with blue background; the
dark shade for abstract information type classes and the light shade
for ordinary information types.
* Association classes are depicted with a white background.
* Complex attributes are depicted with a pink background.
* Enumeration lists and codelists are depicted with a tan background.
The numeric code corresponding to each listed value is shown to its
right following an '=' sign.
* No significance attaches to the colour of associations.
(Complex diagrams may use different colours to distinguish associations
that cross one another.)
* Where the association role or name is not explicitly shown, the
default rules for roles and names apply:
** The role name is 'the<CLASSNAME>' where <CLASSNAME> is the name
of the class to which that association end is linked.
** The association name is '<CLASSNAME1>_<CLASSNAME2>' where <CLASSNAME1>
is the source and <CLASSNAME2> the target. In case of a feature/information
association the feature is the source. For feature/feature or
information/information associations without explicit names the source/target
are indicated by an arrowhead.
* Subclasses inherit the attributes and associations of their superclasses
at all levels, unless such inheritance is explicitly overridden in
the subclass.

==== Domain model

The S-131 domain model has two base classes ('root classes') from
which all the domain-specific geographic features and information
type classes are derived. The base classes are shown in <<fig_4.2>>
below. The base class for geographic features is *FeatureType* and
the base class for information types is *InformationType*. Each of
the two base classes has a set of attributes which are therefore inherited
by all domain-specific features. The approximate area features in
S-131 are also derived from the geographic feature root class. Both
base classes are abstract classes and do not have direct instances
in S-131 data -- instead, S-131 feature and information type data
objects are instantiations of a non-abstract class derived from one
of these base classes.

S-131 meta- and cartographic features are not derived from these base
classes -- S-131 instead incorporates meta- and cartographic feature
definitions originally prepared for S-101 in the interests of harmonization
and interoperability with other S-100-based data products, especially
S-101 ENCs.

===== Overview of domain features and information types

Marine Harbour Infrastructure data products include harbour facilities,
port services and specially designated areas related to ship operations
in ports. It does not include protected areas, obstructions and other
physical features, or natural conditions. The broad categories of
geographic features and non-geographic information included in the
S-131 domain are:

* Harbour layout, including the locations of terminals and berths,
and contact information for terminal operators.
* Port services and related features such as waste reception facilities,
supplies, fuel, and repair facilities.
* Supporting infrastructure such as the nature of nearby transportation.
* The locations of infrastructure such as dry docks and syncrolifts.
* Specially designated locations relating to manoeuvres, such as fairways
and turning basins.

The geographic features are divided into "layout" and "physical infrastructure"
classes, which are used as abstract generalizations of the domain
feature classes. In addition, the *OrganizationContactArea/SupervisedArea*
hierarchy used in other domain models for nautical publications are
used as upper-level generalizations. <<fig_4.3>> depicts the hierarchy
of domain feature classes.

Geographic features use spatial types defined in the geometry package
for spatial attributes. Datasets comprised of S-131 features are described
by metadata as defined in the S-131 metadata package.

[[fig_4.3]]
.Overview of S-131 domain feature classes
image::S-131&#32;Overview.png[]

Information types model chunks of information associated to feature
types. Information types may be associated to other information types
or referenced by associations from feature types. The information
types used in S-131 are depicted in <<fig_4.4>>.

[[fig_4.4]]
.Information types
image::S-131&#32;InfoTypesAbbreviated.png[]

The abstract class *FeatureType* is an abstract class from which the
geographic feature classes in the application schema are derived.
(Meta- and cartographic feature classes do not derive from it.) *FeatureType*
has attributes for fixed and periodic date ranges indicating the effective
dates of the feature, name of the feature, source information, types
of regulations, and a *textContent* attribute that allows text notes
or references to be provided for individual feature instances where
appropriate. The attributes defined in *FeatureType* are inherited
by all S-131 geographic feature types. All the attributes in *FeatureType*
are optional. A derived class may impose additional constraints, which
will be described in the definition of the derived class or the S-131
DCEG. <<fig_4.5>> depicts *FeatureType* and its attributes.

[[fig_4.5]]
.The root class FeatureType
image::Fig&#32;4.5&#32;Root&#32;FeatureType.png[]

The abstract class *InformationType* is an abstract class from which
all the information type classes in the S-131 domain model
(except *SpatialQuality*) are derived. *InformationType* has attributes
for fixed and periodic date ranges, name associated with the individual
information object if any, source information, and a *textContent*
attribute that allows text notes or references to be provided for
individual instances where appropriate. The attributes defined in
*InformationType* are inherited by all S-131 information type classes.
All the attributes of *InformationType* are optional. A derived class
may impose additional constraints, which will be described in the
definition of the derived class or in the S-131 DCEG. <<fig_4.6>>
depicts *InformationType* and its attributes.

[[sec_4.2.1.2]]
===== Layout

Layout features describe the layout of the harbour area. They include
terminal, mooring facilities, special areas within the harbour, berths,
designation of the positioning of specific berths along a wharf or
quay, dock areas, and a *HarbourAreaSection* feature for subdividing
harbour areas into sub-sections.

Note that the current model includes some features which would ideally
be merged into "categoryOfPortSection" attributes of other features,
due to GI Registry conceptual limitations on re-use of concepts.

[[fig_4.7]]
.Layout features
image::S-131&#32;Layout.png[]

[[sec_4.2.1.3]]
===== Physical Infrastructure

Physical infrastructure features include drydock and floating dock
facilities, ship lifts, gridirons, and straddle carriers. The features
are depicted in <<fig_4.8>>. Note that "ship lift" and "straddle carrier"
are modelled as *HarbourFacility* features with a category attribute,
due to current GI Registry conceptual limitations on the use of these
concepts.

[[fig_4.8]]
.Physical Infrastructure features

[[sec_4.2.1.4]]
===== Services

Information about the services available in specific areas is modelled
by means of an information association from the feature to the
*AvailablePortServices* information type. This relationship is depicted
in <<fig_4.9>>. This type contains attributes for encoding various
types of services. Examples of the service enumerations are depicted
in <<fig_4.10>>

[[fig_4.10]]
.Service Enumerations and Codelists
image::S-131&#32;Services&#32;Enumerations.png[]

[[sec_4.2.1.5]]
===== Regulations

There are three main information types which represent regulations,
restrictions, and recommendations, respectively, and a fourth information
type for general or unclassifiable information.

* The *Regulations* class represents information derived from port
regulations, rules made by terminal operators, laws, national shipping
regulations, navigation rules, etc.

* Class *Restrictions* is intended for restrictions that are not derived
from regulatory sources.

* Class *Recommendations* is intended for information that is recommendatory
in nature; in S-131 this may be recommendations for the orientation
of vessels relative to the wharf while docking and similar pieces
of information that are either voluntary or have not been issued as
formal rules by the port authority or terminal operator.

The fourth class, **NauticalInformation**, is intended for general
notes or other information that cannot be categorized as one of the
other three classes.

These information types all inherit the attributes of their immediate
abstract superclass **AbstractRxN**, which provides attributes *textContent*
and *graphic* for textual and pictorial material respectively.
The sub-attributes of its complex attribute *rxnCode* allow optional
classification of the material encoded in *textContent*/*graphic*
according to the type of material and the kind of nautical activity
affected by it. They also inherit the attributes of abstract superclass
**InformationType**, which allows encoding of the effective and expiry
dates, if any, and the source of information
footnote:[Source information is currently broken out into three attributes:
source, sourceType, and reportedDate, due to GI Registry issues with
the complex attribute sourceIndication.],
if it is necessary to encode that data.

These classes are intended primarily for encoding textual information,
such as that which derives from textual source material such as port
handbooks, national or local laws or official publications.

The use of these information types to associate regulatory and other
information to individual features is described elsewhere (<<sec_4.2.1.8>>).
<<fig_4.11>> depicts the *Regulations*, *Restrictions*, *Recommendations*,
and *NauticalInformation* classes, their class hierarchy, and the
attributes of their generalizations *AbstractRxN* and *InformationType*
(which are inherited by the classes).

[[sec_4.2.1.6]]
===== Contact information

The detailed model of contact information is shown in <<fig_4.12>>
below.

[[fig_4.12]]
.Contact information
image::S-131&#32;ContactDetails.png[]

Contact information can be associated to an instance of an *Authority*
information type as well as to any feature that is a subtype of
*OrganizationContactArea*, which means any S-131 geographic feature
(meta and cartographic features do not allow this association). <<fig_4.13>>
shows the associations to *ContactInformation*.

[[fig_4.13]]
.Associations to contact information
image::S-131&#32;ContactDetails&#32;Associations.png[]

[[sec_4.2.1.7]]
===== Supervising organizations and their service hours

The *SupervisedArea* class models areas which may have an associated
organization (government or private) that exercises some kind of control
or supervision over the area.

Operating schedules and business hours of organizations are modelled
by associating the *ServiceHours* class to an *Authority*. The *ServiceHours*
class is a container for the complex attribute describing daily schedules
for different weekdays (*scheduleByDayOfWeek*). This complex attribute
contains another complex attribute for time intervals and the days
to which they apply, and category sub-attribute to model whether the
schedule describes opening hours, closures, etc. Exceptions to the
schedule such as fixed or movable holidays are modelled by a
*NonStandardWorkingDay* class with attributes allowing indication
of the dates or days which are holidays or exceptions.

Working times and schedules for particular features are modelled by
an analogous association from the feature object (association *LocationHours*).
When a *ServiceHours* is thus linked to a service feature, the service
hour information applies to the feature as a whole (e.g., all services
for a *Terminal*). Note that since working hours do not apply to all
features in the model, the associations are to individual features
instead of abstract supertypes.

Working times of 24 hours/day may be explicitly encoded
(from 00:00:00 to 24:00:00 hrs., in accordance with ISO 8601 conventions
for midnight at the beginning and end of a day).

The model for both kinds of schedules is shown in <<fig_4.13>>.

[[fig_4.14]]
.Working times and schedules
image::S-131&#32;WorkingTimes.png[]

The authority should be encoded only if its presence in the dataset
conveys information that is useful to the end user. In S-131 this
is expected to be the general case, but there may be exceptions, such
as when the authority is open for business but a particular location
under its jurisdiction is closed at certain times of day.

Since *Authority* also has an information association to *ContactDetails*
(<<fig_4.13>>), it is in principle possible to link a location to
both an *Authority* and *ContactDetails* as well as linking the location
to the same *ContactDetails*. Such linking is permissible but will
generally be redundant and should, if possible, be avoided as unnecessary
duplication. It may be done in situations where contact details for
an operating authority are different from contact details for the
service it operates.

<<fig_4.13>> also shows associations between service features and
*Authority*. *Authority*-*ContactDetails* associations are omitted
to reduce clutter.

[[sec_4.2.1.8]]
===== Regulations applying in specific locations

The *AssociatedRxN* association between a feature type and a *Regulations*,
*Restrictions*, *Recommendations*, or *NauticalInformation* object
(see <<fig_4.14>>) indicates that the Regulation, etc., is applicable
within the associated feature. If it is necessary to identify an authority
or organization related to a particular regulation (restriction, etc.)
object, this may be done using the *RelatedOrganisation* association
between *Regulations*, etc., and an *Authority* object. This should
be included only when the connection to the *Authority* conveys useful
information to the end user -- it is not intended to encode the issuing
or controlling authority for every regulation. Note also that while
*Authority* can be associated to geographic features as well as *Regulations*,
etc., encoding both associations is not mandatory even when the same
*Authority* is associated to a service area as well as a *Regulations*
object (or *NauticalInformation*, etc.).

[[fig_4.15]]
.Regulations, etc., applying to specific features
image::S-131&#32;RulesForFeatures.png[]

[[sec_4.2.1.9]]
===== Regulations applying only to vessels with specific characteristics or cargoes

Certain regulations apply only to vessels of specified dimensions,
types, or carrying specified cargo, etc.

This is modelled by first defining the relevant subset of vessels
according to the dimension, type, cargo, etc., and then associating
that subset to the appropriate feature or information type.
The subset of vessels is modelled using the *Applicability* class,
which contains attributes for the most common vessel characteristics
used in nautical publications. These include measurements
(length, beam, draught), type of cargo, displacement, etc. Constraints
which cannot be modelled using the attributes of *Applicability* can
be described in plain text in its *information* attribute.

Conditions relating to vessel dimensions are modelled by the complex
attribute **vesselsMeasurements**, which has sub-attributes for naming
the dimension and indicating the limit (whether the condition applies
to a vessel which exceeds or falls below the limit). For example,
the combinations below describe the condition
"length overall > 50 m" (Condition 1) and "length overall < 90 m"
(Condition 2):

[[table_4.1]]
.Conditions relating to vessel dimensions
[cols="181,118,118,117"]
|===
| h| Condition 1 h| Condition 2 h| Condition 3

| *vesselsCharacteristics*      | length overall | length overall | breadth
| *comparisonOperator*          | greater than   | less than      | greater than
| *vesselsCharacteristicsValue* | 50             | 90             | 20
| *vesselsCharacteristicsUnit*  | metre          | metre          | metre
|===

The *logicalConnectives* attribute is used to indicate how to interpret
the case where multiple conditions are encoded using attributes of
measurements - whether the conditions described by condition attributes
are cumulative (conjunctive, AND) or alternatives (disjunctive, OR).
A *logicalConnectives*=AND combined with Conditions 1 and 2 above
describes a vessel of length between 50 and 90 metres; *logicalConnectives*=OR
combined with conditions 1 and 3 describes a vessel of length greater
than 50 metres or beam greater than 20 metres.

This modelling cannot represent subsets defined by both AND and OR
combinations of conditions, but it is always possible to convert such
complex conditions into multiple combinations each using only AND
('conjunctive normal form') or OR ('disjunctive normal form'), and
model the subset using more than one *Applicability* object. Multiple
instances of Applicability associated to the same feature or information
type are interpreted as alternatives (inclusive OR).

<<fig_4.15>> depicts the classes and attributes that can be used to
define subsets of vessels according to specified characteristics.

[[fig_4.16]]
.Vessel subsets characterised by cargo, dimensions and capabilities
image::S-131&#32;ShipCharacteristicSubsets.png[]

Given the relevant subset of vessels, it can be associated to the
appropriate feature, regulation, or report by a *PermissionType*,
or *InclusionType* association. These are association classes, whose
single attribute models the nature of the relationship between the
vessel subset and feature or information type. <<fig_4.16>> depicts
the use of vessel subsets in *PermissionType* or *InclusionType* associations.

The association classes *PermissionType* and *InclusionType* basically
characterize the relationship. For example:

. A specified set of vessels is COVERED by a regulation and another
set of vessels is EXEMPT from the regulation.
. Vessels with specified cargo and dimensions MUST use a specified
berth, vessels of smaller dimensions are RECOMMENDED to use the berth,
and naval transports are EXEMPT from using the berth.

"COVERED" and "EXEMPT" are different kinds of relationship between
different subsets of vessels characterized by different dimensional
limits, etc., and a given regulation.

"MUST use", "RECOMMENDED to use", and "EXEMPT from use" are relationships
between different subsets of vessels characterized by different dimensional
limits, etc., and a given feature or service.

[[fig_4.17]]
.Applicability of rules, etc., to vessel categories
image::S-131&#32;ApplicabilityAssociations.png[]

*PermissionType* links a feature to an *Applicability*, and models
a requirement, recommendation or prohibition on entry into a feature,
by the specified subset of vessels.

*Inclusion* links a *Regulation*, *Recommendation*, *Restriction*,
or *NauticalInformation* instance to a subset defined by an Applicability
object, and indicates whether the content of the *Regulation*, etc.,
applies to the vessels (membership=included), or whether it explicitly
does not apply (membership=excluded).

Informally:

. *Applicability* describes the set of vessels: i.e., who

. *Regulations* provides the text of the regulation: i.e., what

. The association class *InclusionType* describes the relationship
between who and what. That is, who "must (or can)" / "need not" do
what.

And:-

[start=4]
. A geographic feature defines a location or physical facility: i.e.,
where

. The association class PermissionType describes the relationship
between who and where. That is, who can / must / should / need not
use (or sail) where.

[[sec_4.2.1.10]]
===== Other uncategorized supplementary information

The domain model also provides a method for attaching to any feature
or information type data in the form of a text note, graphic, or Internet
reference which cannot be categorized using an appropriate feature
or information type. This consists of defining a *NauticalInformation*
object and referencing it from the feature or information type using
the *AdditionalInformation* association. This method is intended to
be a last resort and every effort should be made to use a more specific
feature or information type to encode the information to be attached,
including splitting the information in question across more than one
type of feature or information object as needed and/or using the
*AssociatedRxN* association instead of *AdditionalInformation*, wherever
the nature of the content allows it. See <<fig_4.17>>.

[[fig_4.18]]

[[sec_4.2.1.11]]
===== "Wrapper" complex attributes

S-131 provides a general method for encoding some kinds of information
using "wrapper" attributes that are basically a named type of text
content. The information is encoded in narrative form in a *textContent*
sub-attribute, which provides a general way to encode textual information.
<<fig_4.19>> depicts the wrapper attributes.

[[fig_4.19]]
.Wrapper Attributes
image::S-131&#32;Wrapper&#32;Attributes.png[]

[[sec_4.2.1.12]]
===== Feature relationships

Feature relationships in S-131 are depicted in <<fig_4.19>>. The feature
relationships can be generally characterized as follows:

*HarbourAreaAdministrative* is the main feature that covers the whole
port area. It is subdivided into zero or more sections modelled by
*HarbourAreaSection* features (the *LayoutDivision*) aggregation.
*HarbourAreaSection* can be further subdivided into *WaterwayArea*,
*Terminal*, *Berth*, *AnchorageArea*, *DockArea*, etc. The *Terminal*
feature can also be subdivided into *Berth* features using the same
association.

*HarbourAreaSection* can also be subdivided into further features
of the same class (the *SubUnit* self-association).

Nominal positions of berths can be indicated by associating a *BerthPosition*
feature to *Berth* using the *Demarcation* association.

Berth positions and Anchor berths can be linked to a mooring facility
using the *PrimaryAuxiliaryFacility* association.

Physical infrastructure features in a Terminal or *HarbourAreaSection*
feature should be linked to its container *Terminal* or *HarbourAreaSection*
by an *Infrastructure* association. If there is an hierarchy of features
containing the infrastructure only the feature at the lowest level
of the hierarchy should be linked to the infrastructure feature.

The outer limit of the whole harbour area can be associated to
*HarbourAreaAdministrative* feature using a *JurisdictionalLimit*
association.

[[fig_4.20]]
.Relationships between geographic features

[[sec_4.2.2]]
==== Meta Features

S-131 provides four meta-features:

* *DataCoverage* for describing areas in the cell that are populated
with data. If the cell must include distant areas that are not part
of the port area, such areas will generally be excluded from the *DataCoverage*
feature(s).
* *QualityOfNonbathymetricData* for encoding quality information.
* *SoundingDatum* and *VerticalDatum* for encoding information about
the datums for depths and elevations respectively.

<<fig_4.21>> depicts the meta-features and their attributes.

[[sec_4.2.3]]
==== Spatial Quality Information Type

S-131 spatial quality of spatial primitives is encoded in the SpatialQuality
information type, which is associated to spatial objects. The modelling
is the same as in S-101. The attributes describe qualitative and quantitative
horizontal quality. See <<fig_4.22>>.

[[fig_4.22]]
.Spatial Quality
image::S-131&#32;Spatial&#32;Quality.png[]

[[sec_4.2.4]]
==== Cartographic Features

S-131 utilizes a single cartographic feature called TextPlacement
that is to optimise text positioning, such as at smaller scales to
prevent cluttering. This feature can be associated to any geographic
feature and gives the location of a text string relative to the location
of the feature. The modelling and use are the same as in S-101.
See <<fig_4.23>>.
